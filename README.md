# Create Graphql App

Boilerplate for quick scaffolding of a [Typescript][] [GraphQL][] [Apollo][] server in a monorepo, with automatic typescript type generation via the [Graphql code generator][] and code formatting via [prettier][].

[typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/ 'So hot right now'
[graphql]: https://graphql.org/ 'A query language for your API'
[graphql code generator]: https://graphql-code-generator.com 'Works better than the apollo codegen!'
[apollo]: https://www.apollographql.com/ 'Do GraphQL right!'
[prettier]: https://prettier.io/ 'I wish every language had a prettier'

## Usage

Fork/clone the repo and cd into the root folder:

```sh
nvm use
yarn

cd graphql
yarn
yarn dev
```

After the initial typescript compilation, you should be able to see the playground running on http://localhost:3010 ðŸš€

The project will auto recompile and reload on every code change. Give it a whirl!

## Testing

There is a sample test for the sample resolver using [Jest] to get you going; substitute your own and run tests with:

```sh
yarn test # single run all the tests

yarn test --watch # auto-reloading run of relevant tests
```

## Deployment

Since my projects nowadays are so commonly deployed to [Google App Engine], there's some minimal configuration to deploy the graphql server as the default service of an App Engine project. Substitute your own and it should "just work". Well, if you have deployed something to google app engine before, or have setup [Google Cloud Build].

## Contributing

This is by no means **the** way to get a project like this started. It's not the perfect way to write your schemas, nor the perfect way to write your resolvers, nor the perfect way to generate your types. It is the best way _I_ know how to do it, and would heartily welcome any help and input to make it even better!
